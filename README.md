## Data Collection
The data collected for this project spans multiple years (2018-2021) and consists of key metrics related to hospital patient waiting lists. The datasets contain the following columns: Archive_Date, Speciality_HIPE, Speciality, Adult_Child, Age_Profile, Time_Band, and Total. Each dataset represents snapshots of patient waiting lists, categorized by medical specialty, age profiles, and waiting times.

The data is structured to provide insights into:

Medical Specialties: Information is organized by different medical specialties to analyze demand and waiting times within various departments. Demographics: Distinctions are made between adult and child patients, alongside detailed age profiles, helping to understand the population distribution. Time Bands: This shows the distribution of patients by waiting time, categorized into bands to track how long patients are waiting for treatments or consultations. Yearly Comparisons: Data collected over the years 2018 to 2021 enables year-on-year comparisons, highlighting trends and changes in healthcare waiting times and patient demographics. This dataset serves as a foundation for understanding the operational dynamics of hospital waiting lists, patient demographics, and the workload across medical specialties over time.

## Data Cleaning and Pre-Processing
A crucial Data Cleaning and Pre-Processing step using Microsoft Excel is conducted. Here's a short summary of that process:
1)Rectified Wrong Dates: Ensured that the date formats across the dataset were consistent and corrected any invalid or incorrectly formatted dates.
2)Updated Missing Values: Filled in missing data by imputing or manually updating key fields to ensure completeness. This step is essential for ensuring the accuracy of the analysis and preventing errors in Power BI.
3)Checked CSV Format: Verified that all CSV files were properly formatted, ensuring they were comma-separated and free of inconsistencies like unnecessary delimiters or formatting issues.
4)These cleaning steps helped prepare the raw data for ingestion into Power BI, ensuring that the subsequent transformation and analysis steps would be accurate and reliable.

## Data Transformation & Modelling
The process of transforming and preparing data for analysis in Power BI is demonstrated. This step involves using Power Query to clean and reshape the raw data, ensuring it is suitable for analysis and visualization. The key transformations include handling missing data, filtering unnecessary information, and creating new calculated columns or measures to enhance the dataset.

Once the data is transformed, it moves into the data modelling phase, where relationships between different tables are established, allowing the data to be connected meaningfully across the dashboard. This is critical for building an efficient data model that ensures smooth analysis, reporting, and querying across various datasets.

## Data Visualization Blueprint:
The Visualization Blueprint process is introduced. This step involves planning how the data will be represented visually. The focus is on defining key performance indicators (KPIs), setting up the charts, graphs, and tables, and ensuring that the visualizations align with the goals of the report. The blueprint ensures that the visuals communicate the insights effectively and are designed with user experience in mind. Before building, the structure of the dashboard is laid out to ensure that all necessary data points are captured and that visual hierarchies are clear.



## Dashboard Layout & Design
We walks through the Layout & Design Workflow for creating an efficient and intuitive dashboard in Power BI. This involves arranging the visual elements on the canvas, applying consistent formatting, and using design principles such as balance, contrast, and emphasis to guide the userâ€™s attention to important information. It is crucial to maintain a clear, uncluttered design that improves readability and facilitates interaction. The layout design ensures that the dashboard looks professional and provides a seamless user experience.

## Interactivity & Navigation:
The process of Adding Interactivity & Navigation to the Power BI dashboard is covered. This includes implementing features like slicers, drill-throughs, and buttons that allow users to interact with the report dynamically. Slicers enable filtering of data, while drill-throughs let users explore detailed information behind the visualizations. The navigation design ensures that the dashboard is not only informative but also interactive, providing users with the flexibility to explore the data at different levels and personalize their insights.

## Publishing & Sharing:
Finally Publishing & Sharing the Power BI report is done. After the completion of the dashboard, it is published in github, making it accessible to other users. Sharing options are explored, such as granting access to specific individuals or groups, enabling collaboration, and setting up scheduled refreshes to keep the report updated with the latest data. This step ensures that the insights generated from the report are widely accessible and actionable across the organization, facilitating data-driven decision-making.
